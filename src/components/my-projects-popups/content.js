Itâ€™s far from being perfect, especially in terms of UI/UX design but it implements elements that are present in most applications today: authentication and authorization with 2FA is some places, back-end database, responsive UI for mobile users, simple search system, automated sending emails to users and many more.

It's mostly front-end project written in JavaScript using React.

This application consists of three main parts: client, API and TF model server. Client is written in Java and Android Studio an native mobile application. API created with Python and Flask handles requests from API, image preprocessing and processing of predictions made by TF model server. TF model server handles efficient predictions and interactions with machine learning model.`,
